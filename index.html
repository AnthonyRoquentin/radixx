<h1> Observe the Simulation </h1>

The posts below are randomly generated text based on the network's current state, and are pushed to the blog in real-time as it trains. The most recent 30 posts are below, and you can browse further back using the arrows at the bottom.  
The progression from one symbol order to the next <i>as we recognize them</i> increases substantially over time, so it'll get increasingly stranger the further you browse back in the logs.  
Enjoy!
