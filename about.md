**Radixx** (previously *SexRobotz*) is a live simulation of the Single-Direcive Emergent Learning (SDEL) model of cognitive semiotics, which is an extension of [procedural rhetoric](http://www.arts.rpi.edu/public_html/ruiz/EGDFall10/readings/RhetoricVideoGames_Bogost.pdf) and [deconstructionism](https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/derrida/deconstruction.html).

The neural network was designed in Python using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), and trains on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). I would have used Twitter instead of a blog, but their new 'request API access' thing kept me waiting too long, so I did this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog instead.

This research wasn't supported by anyone. But Snoop Dogg gave me the courage to press through, and that's not nothing, so... represent.
